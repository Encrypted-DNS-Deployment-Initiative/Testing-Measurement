# Testing-Measurement

From the brainstorming list:
- Would be nice to have a standard recommended dnsperf test configuration, so across different implementers there is an apples-to-apples benchmark tool - https://www.dnsperf.com/
- This can also be used by independent measurement researcher & orgs
- Seems like a key early task
- GUI utility for querying DNS via DoH, DoT or UDP - https://github.com/wttw/dox
